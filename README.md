# GPEN-Index
My very own custom index I used to pass the GPEN exam on September 2018. Please note that page numbers might soon become irrelevant as the SEC560 courseware might be updated.

**I recommend everyone to build their own index as the process of doing so is a very effective way to study for the exam in my opinion.**
